## Overview:

Bookshelf is a open source organization where my friend and I collaborated to developed our final year project on the computer engineering major.

The organization is basically a software developed, to exhale and faciliate the bibliomaniacs reading routine. 
Bookshelf is a fully function website where readers can signup/signin, add new a want-to-read bookshelves, also fork/unfork other bibliomaniacs bookshelves. 
According to the bookshelves collected by a user, a machine learning algorithm will generate a books recommendation which covers their interest.


## Features:
### Authentication & Authorization
  We've used google authentication/authorization to make authentication/authorization safer and easier.
### Dashboard
  The dashboard contains the following 3 sections:
#### Popular Bookshelves:
  Here we've used the popularity based recommendation algorithm and most forked books feature to display popular bookshelves.
